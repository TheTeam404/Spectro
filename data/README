# Data Directory

This directory stores data used by or generated by the LIBS Software application.

## Subdirectories:

*   **`uploads/`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Temporary storage location for raw spectrum files uploaded by the user via the interface.
    *   **Git:** This directory is **ignored by Git** (via `.gitignore`) to prevent committing user data. A `.gitkeep` file ensures the empty directory structure can be tracked initially.
    *   **Content:** Files are typically placed here by the `api_server.py` during the `/api/load` process and may be deleted after successful loading or on error (depending on implementation choices).

*   **`nist_cache/`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Default cache location for `astroquery`. Storing query results here speeds up subsequent requests for the same NIST data.
    *   **Git:** This directory is **ignored by Git**. Created automatically by `astroquery` if caching is enabled (usually default).

*   **`calibration/`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Intended storage location for user-provided calibration data files (e.g., calibration curves in JSON or CSV format used by the `analysis.quantification` module).
    *   **Git:** You might choose to **commit example or default calibration files** here, but potentially ignore user-specific ones if necessary. Add specific ignore patterns to `.gitignore` if needed (e.g., `data/calibration/user_*.json`).
    *   **Content Example:** Contains files like `example_Fe_curve.json` or `material_XYZ_calibration.csv`.

*   **`models/`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Intended storage location for pre-trained Machine Learning models (`.joblib`, `.pkl`, `.h5`, etc.) and corresponding scalers used by the `analysis.ml_methods` module.
    *   **Git:** Similar to calibration files, **example models might be committed**, but large or user-trained models are often ignored. Update `.gitignore` accordingly (e.g., `data/models/*.joblib`).
    *   **Content Example:** Contains files like `material_classifier_v1.joblib`, `pls_concentration_model.pkl`, `standard_scaler.joblib`.

*   **`samples/`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Storage for example or standard LIBS spectrum files (`.csv`, `.txt`, etc.) used for testing, demonstration, or included by default with the software.
    *   **Git:** Sample files are typically **committed to Git** so users and developers have test data available.
    *   **Content Example:** Contains files like `soil_sample_01.csv`, `steel_standard_ref.txt`.

*   **`.gitkeep` files**: Empty files placed in otherwise empty directories (`uploads/`, `nist_cache/`, `calibration/`, `models/`, `samples/` initially) to ensure Git can track the directory structure even before any actual data is added. These files can be safely deleted once real data is present in a directory.
