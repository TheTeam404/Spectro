# Pre-Trained Models

This directory may contain pre-trained machine learning models and scalers.

*   **`example_pca_model.joblib`**: Example PCA model trained on sample data.
*   **`example_scaler.joblib`**: StandardScaler fitted to the data used for `example_pca_model.joblib`.

Ensure required libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, joblib) are installed (`requirements.txt`) before attempting to load these models via the analysis tools. Model versions might be sensitive to library versions used during training.
